# Uncertain Items - Need Clarification

Items from the inventory that I'm unsure how to categorize. Please indicate where each should go.

## RESOLVED (from user feedback)

| Item | Destination | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `Ava's Lewd: Frame corset (wear me)` | BDSM/Clothing/Corsets | ✅ Corset brand rule added |
| `[LUNAFELL] - Eclipse Corset - FULLPACK` | BDSM/Clothing/Corsets | ✅ Corset brand rule added |
| `[Erica's corner] Velatrix corset and whip PBR` | BDSM/Clothing/Corsets (corset), Clothing/Accessories (whip) | ✅ Split rules added |
| `Latex` (folder) | Materials | ✅ Contains Heavy Latex & Smooth Latex materials |
| `FACS - Custom Hose Modular Pantyhose FULL 1.3 2K Update` | Clothing/Hosiery | ✅ Matches "Pantyhose" keyword |
| `VELOUR: The "Ipanema Body" for Maitreya (BLUSH)` | Body Parts/Skins | ✅ Matches "Body" keyword (body skin) |

## Rule Philosophy

**Important**: Rules should match on **what the item IS** (product type keywords) rather than **who made it** (brand names).

A store can release multiple product types, so:
- ❌ `FACS` → Hosiery (brand-specific, FACS could make shoes)
- ✅ `Pantyhose|Stockings|Tights` → Hosiery (product keywords)

Exceptions: Brands that ONLY make one type of product (e.g., LeLUTKA only makes heads, KDC only makes BDSM restraints)

## Category Uncertain

### Could be Clothing or Accessories?

|------|---------------|-------|
| `[BB] Belzebubble - Nipple Rings` | Body Parts? | Piercings - body jewelry |
| `KUNI - Sharon (Color HUD Pack) (v3)` | ??? | Unknown brand - what is this? |

| `[chouette] Auto Teleporter HUD (wear/rez to unpack) (v1.02)` | Objects? Scripts? | Utility HUD |

### Skin/Body Brands I Don't Recognize

| Item | My Best Guess | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `OMY Megan Fatpack` | Body Parts? | Is OMY a skin brand? |
| `2faces - "UNA" - full pack` | Body Parts | Sounds like skin/face |

## Questions for You

1. **Corsets** - Should corsets go to BDSM or Clothing? (or depends on the brand?)

2. **Latex items** - All latex = BDSM? Or some latex is fashion?

3. **Piercings/body jewelry** - Body Parts or Accessories?

4. **Pantyhose/hosiery** - Clothing or separate category?

5. **Body deformers** (butt fixers, shape adjusters) - Body Parts?

6. **Welcome packages** - Leave at root or have a category?

7. **Utility HUDs** (teleporters, pose stands, etc.) - Objects? Scripts? Leave alone?
